# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a Web Developer.

## Description

This portfolio website is built using HTML, with styles included directly in the HTML file.  It serves as a personal space to highlight my work.

## Features

This portfolio website was created using the following technologies and methods:

- **HTML**: The structure of the website is built entirely with HTML. I used semantic HTML elements to ensure the content is well-organized and accessible.
  
- **Inline CSS**: All styles are included directly within the HTML file using `<style>` tags. This approach allows for quick styling adjustments and keeps everything in one file for simplicity.

- **Responsive Design**: I implemented responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks good on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This was achieved using relative units (like percentages) and media queries.
  
- **Testing**: I tested the website across different browsers to ensure compatibility and a consistent user experience.
